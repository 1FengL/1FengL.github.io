In NLP, words are the main objects that we are dealing with. How should we represent words in a form that computers can store? A straightforward answer can be let's representing them as discrete symbols:
$$dog = [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ... 0 0]$$
$$cat = [0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0]$$



$$dog = [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ... 0 0]
cat = [0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0]$$
